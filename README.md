# Pusher Hacktoberfest Contributor Guide ðŸŽƒ

Hacktoberfest 2022 is finally here, and we're pretty excited about it. Open source developers also play a crucial role in making our API's accessible and compatible with different ecosystems. We think it's a great time to encourage, recognise and reward developers in the community who dedicate their time to creating for others.

## What is Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) is an annual festival hosted by DigitalOcean that takes place in the month of October to celebrate the open source community. As part of this 31-day celebration, contributors and open source maintainers are encouraged to work on open source projects and win swag to mark the occasion.
